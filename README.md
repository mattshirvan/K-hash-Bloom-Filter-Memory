# K-Hash Bloom Filter Memory
 K-Hash Bloom Filter Memory for RL Agents.

## Overview
This algorithm proposes the use of a k-hash bloom filter as a complementary data structure to the replay buffer in reinforcement learning (RL) agents. The k-hash bloom filter allows for efficient long-term storage of past observations and their associated rewards, while also reducing redundant storage of similar experiences.

## Methodology
The algorithm works by mapping each observation to k different bit positions in the bloom filter using k different hash functions. This approach helps to reduce the false positive rate and improve the accuracy of the membership queries. The bloom filter is used to check whether an observation has been seen before, and if so, it is not added to the replay buffer again.

## Benefits
- Efficient storage and retrieval of past observations and rewards
- Reduction in redundant storage of similar experiences
- Low false positive rate
- Complementary data structure to the replay buffer

## Usage
To use this algorithm, simply incorporate the k-hash bloom filter into your RL agent's memory management system. Tune the parameters such as the number of hash functions and the size of the filter based on the size of the observation space and the memory limitations of your system.
